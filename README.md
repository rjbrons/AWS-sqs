## Set Up Queues
In AWS SQS dashboard select "Create New Queue"
Keep the defaults and type in a name for the queue.
Note: once you have queues created, if you select one in the dashboard you can see information about it on the bottom half of the screen.  Of particular interest for you will be the URL and ARN values shown there.  You will use these to "find" your queue.
